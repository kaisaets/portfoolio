        <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>My name is Kaisa Ets, and I am 30 years old. I have previously studied at University of
            Tartu PÃ¤rnu College, where I graduated from tourism and hotel management. After working
            in the field for a few years, I attended career counseling. After analyzing the results,
            I decided to take some lT courses to gain more insight. This, in turn, made me want to
            gain a deeper understanding of the subject, so I applied to Tartu Vocational College,
            specializing in software development and was accepted. </p>
